fcs_matrixfit.py
================
Correlation modelling by linear decomposition -- the "matrix method".

Where fcs_fit takes a model with a handful of named parameters and searches
for the values that minimise the residual, this module fixes a large basis of
candidate curves up front and asks only how much of each is present.  The
answer comes from one linear solve, with no initial guesses, no bounds, no
iteration and no possibility of converging to a local minimum.

    G  ~  A d        A : (m, n) basis, one column per candidate decay time
                     d : (n,) amplitudes, the thing being fitted

The amplitudes are constrained to d >= 0 on physical grounds, except for the
final baseline column which is free to take either sign.  The spread of d
across the grid is the point of the method: a result concentrated on a few
neighbouring columns says the decay time is well determined, a broad one says
it is not, without either answer having been presupposed by the choice of
model.

The linear algebra and the basis itself live in fcs_linsolve.  This module is
the analysis layer: reading correlation CSVs, deciding what sigma means,
running one solve per dataset, plotting, and writing the exports.

Each dataset produces TWO figures -- the curve with its residuals, and the
amplitude distribution -- because they are functions of different quantities
and must not be forced onto a shared axis.  Both go through
fcs_plottools.show_figure, so each carries the standard plot-controls panel.

Entry point
-----------
    run_matrix_dialog(fcs_data, parent, workspace_order)

reached from Model Data > "Correlation (Matrix Method)".

Outputs
-------
One timestamped folder per run, under the same ``fits/`` directory the other
fitters use, containing:

    <stem>_report.txt          human-readable summary, one block per dataset
    <stem>_curves.csv          tau, G, sigma, fit, residuals   (long format)
    <stem>_distribution.xlsx   tau_char, d, d_err per basis vector (long format)
    <stem>_summary.csv/.xlsx   one row of scalars per dataset

The distribution is kept in its own file rather than folded into the summary
table: with a fine grid there are hundreds of amplitudes per dataset, and a
parameter table one row per dataset cannot hold them without becoming
unreadable.  Pairing each amplitude with its characteristic time in the same
file is what makes the distribution directly plottable.
